# Module-5


In order to complete this project I used ideas from teh activites in the matplotlib module in order to understand how to plot. When there were moments where I was stuck on something I would use stackoverflow in order to find the correct way to plot data. 

One thing that I had to focus on in order to correctly complete this challenge was the difference in between plotting with pandas and pyplot. In order to do this, I referred to the powerpoints from lessons and stackoverflow documentation.
